/**
 * Class used to implement performant, good-quality and intelligent image
 * scaling algorithms in native Java. This class utilizes the Java2D
 * "best practices" for image-scaling, ensuring that images are hardware
 * accelerated at all times if provided by the platform and host-VM.
 * <p/>
 * All scaling operations implemented by this class maintain the proportion of
 * the original image. If image-cropping is desired the caller will need to
 * perform those edits before calling one of the <code>resize</code> methods
 * provided by this class.
 * <p/>
 * In order to maintain the proportionality of the original images, this class
 * implements the following default behavior:
 * <ol>
 * <li>If the image is LANDSCAPE-oriented or SQUARE, treat the
 * <code>targetWidth</code> as the primary dimension and re-calculate the
 * <code>targetHeight</code> regardless of what is passed in.</li>
 * <li>If image is PORTRAIT-oriented, treat the <code>targetHeight</code> as the
 * primary dimension and re-calculate the <code>targetWidth</code> regardless of
 * what is passed in.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Recalculation of the secondary dimensions is extremely cheap to the point of
 * it being negligible and this design provides users with better
 * expected-behavior from the library; which is why this approach was chosen.
 * <p/>
 * This class implements a few different methods for scaling an image, providing
 * either the best-looking result or the fastest result depending on the scaling
 * hint provided (see {@link Method}).
 * <p/>
 * This class also implements the incremental scaling algorithm presented by
 * Chris Campbell in his <a href="http://today.java
 * .net/pub/a/today/2007/04/03/perils-of-image-getscaledinstance.html">Perils of
 * Image.getScaledInstance()</a> article in order to give the best-looking
 * results to images scaled down below roughly 800px in size where using a
 * single scaling operation (even with
 * {@link RenderingHints#VALUE_INTERPOLATION_BICUBIC} interpolation) would
 * produce a much worse-looking result.
 * <p/>
 * Minor modifications are made to Campbell's original implementation in the
 * form of:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Instead of accepting a user-supplied interpolation method,
 * {@link RenderingHints#VALUE_INTERPOLATION_BICUBIC} interpolation is always
 * used. This was done after A/B comparison testing with large images
 * down-scaled to thumbnail sizes showed noticeable "blurring" when BILINEAR
 * interpolation was used. Given that Campbell's algorithm is only used in
 * QUALITY mode when down-scaling, it was determined that the user's expectation
 * of a much less blurry picture would require that BICUBIC be the default
 * interpolation in order to meet the QUALITY expectation.</li>
 * <li>After each iteration of the do-while loop that incrementally scales the
 * source image down, an effort is made to explicitly call
 * {@link BufferedImage#flush()} on the interim temporary {@link BufferedImage}
 * instances created by the algorithm in an attempt to ensure a more complete GC
 * cycle by the VM when cleaning up the temporary instances.</li>
 * <li>Extensive comments have been added to increase readability of the code.</li>
 * <li>Variable names have been expanded to increase readability of the code.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>NOTE</strong>: This class does not call {@link BufferedImage#flush()}
 * on any of the <em>source images</em> passed in by calling code; it is up to
 * the original caller to dispose of their source images when they are no longer
 * needed so the VM can most efficiently GC them.
 * <h3>Generated Image Types</h3>
 * Java2D provides support for a number of different image types defined as
 * <code>BufferedImage.TYPE_*</code> variables, unfortunately not all image
 * types are supported equally in Java2D. Some more obscure image types either
 * have poor or no support, leading to severely degraded quality when an attempt
 * is made by imgscalr to create a scaled instance <em>of the same type</em> as
 * the source image.
 * <p/>
 * To avoid imgscalr generating significantly worse-looking results than
 * alternative scaling approaches (e.g.
 * {@link Image#getScaledInstance(int, int, int)}), all resultant images
 * generated by imgscalr are of one of two types:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link BufferedImage#TYPE_INT_RGB}</li>
 * <li>{@link BufferedImage#TYPE_INT_ARGB}</li>
 * </ol>
 * depending on if the source image utilizes transparency or not.
 * <p/>
 * This is a recommended approach by the Java2D team for dealing with poorly (or
 * non) supported image types. More can be read about this issue <a href=
 * "http://www.mail-archive.com/java2d-interest@capra.eng.sun.com/msg05621.html"
 * >here</a>.
 * <h3>Logging</h3>
 * This class implements all its debug logging via the
 * {@link #log(String, Object...)} method. At this time logging is done directly
 * to <code>System.out</code> via the <code>printf</code> method. This allows
 * the logging to be light weight and easy to capture.
 * <p/>
 * Implementation of logging in this class is as efficient as possible; avoiding
 * any calls to the logger or passing of arguments if logging is not enabled.

	 * Modifications to the original algorithm are variable names and comments
	 * added for clarity and the hard-coding of using BICUBIC interpolation as
	 * well as the explicit "flush()" operation on the interim BufferedImage
	 * instances to avoid resource leaking.
	 * 
	 * @param src
	 *            The image that will be scaled.
	 * @param targetWidth
	 *            The target width for the scaled image.
	 * @param targetHeight
	 *            The target height for the scaled image.
	 * @param interpolationHintValue
	 *            The {@link RenderingHints} interpolation value used to
	 *            indicate the method that {@link Graphics2D} should use when
	 *            scaling the image.
	 * 
	 * @return an image scaled to the given dimensions using the given rendering
